NEXHK came from the capstone project with the same goals and problems to solve. But after the successful deliveration of our thesis, we saw that the HKSMMSv1(Former nexhk) could do more, and was capable of becoming an industry level proejct, that not worthy of the client trust and investement, but also aims to transform the way how PHINMA AU management Hawak Kamay scholars. That's why, we decided to upgrade the HKSMMSv1 to NEXHK. 

The challenges faced by the PHINMA AU, is first currently they use untigrated platforms such us, google forms, sheets, paper based systems or files. Inefficient process like management of scholar profile as they create new spreadsheet each year to store updated data of scholars. Duty assignment can be time consuming since scheduled are need to be filtered and fit to each of the students.  Duty recording lacks of integrity. Renewakl of scholarship composed of multiple manual steps. :ast chalnnges is the increasing number, it grows every year, and we believe that as long as the scholars grow, This challeneges will be harder and harder to manage.
